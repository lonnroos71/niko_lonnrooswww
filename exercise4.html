    <h1>History</h1>
<p>
        
             Coca-Cola is a carbonated, non-alcoholic soft drink made by The Coca-Cola Company. Coca-Cola is the world's best-selling soft drink and the world's sixth most valuable brand. Coca-Cola has been sold in the United States since 1886. It was developed by Atlanta pharmacist John Pemberton as a drug-like stimulant. Coca-Cola gained the status of a US national beverage in the early 20th century and spread throughout the world with the help of US soldiers throughout the century. Today, it is available from almost every country in the world, except for North Korea and Cuba.Coca-Cola's exact recipe is a secret. The drink takes its name from the coca leaves and cola nuts originally contained in it. The drink contains caffeine.
